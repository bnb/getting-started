## Want to contribute to Node.js but don't know where to start?

Welcome! You've come to the right place. You can jump right in by going to the working group guides below. You can accelerate getting started in any of these working groups by being introduced to a member of the working group who is knowledgable in the work you'd like to tackle. Context to approaching problems is important and these introductions can save you time working on something the collaborators have already tackled. If you'd like an introduction, [file an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) with
- what you'd like to work on or the challenge you're facing
- the working group (if known)

and we'll label your request as `intro requested`. A collaborator will facilitate this for you.

### Group contributing guides
- [Website WG](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)<br>
  The Website WG is primarily concerned with the code and overall structure of the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) website. The site is built with a static site generator, and uses HTML, CSS, and other common tooling for that. 
- [Docs WG](https://github.com/nodejs/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-docs)<br>
  This group serves as a central place for Node.js documentation coordination, but not documentation itself. They will help get you there.
- [HTTP2](https://github.com/nodejs/http2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-nodejs)<br>
  This repository focuses on an HTTP/2 implementation for Node.js Core, which 
- [citgm](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes-to-citgm)<br>
  citgm is a tool for pulling down an arbitrary module from npm and testing it using a specific version of the Node.js runtime. The Node.js project uses citgm to smoketest releases and controversial changes. This tool has become an important part of the release process, and is always looking for contributors.
- [Diagnostics WG](https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics#diagnostics-working-group)<br>
  The Diagnostics WG ensures Node.js provides a set of comprehensive, documented, extensible diagnostic protocols, formats, and APIs to enable tool vendors to provide reliable diagnostic tools for Node.js including tracing, profiling, heap and memory analysis, and step debugging. The Diagnostics WG is a group of people working on low-level, deep technical problems to build tooling for the community to use for debugging, tracing, and other diagnostic purposes.
- [Community Committee](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#nodejs-community-contributing-guide-10)<br>
  The Community Committee tackles challenges within the Node.js project that require the many roles outside of code contribution vital to sustaining a healthy open source project. This includes efforts like building out community events, projects that help individuals succeed with Node.js, and more.
- [Node.js Collection](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-collection#the-nodejs-collection-team)<br>
  A place for people to organize the technical editing process for articles submitted to The Node.js Collection, the official community-driven Medium Publication for the Node.js Project.
- [Evangelism WG](https://github.com/nodejs/evangelism#evangelism)<br>
  The Evangelism WG helps create and maintain community-focused materials and resources, brings discussions to a wider audience, and attempts to grow the community through positive, supportive messaging. While _evangelism_ itself is hard to measure, the Evangelsim WG is a collective and long-term effort to help widen the message and community around Node.js.
- [Education](https://github.com/nodejs/education#education-in-nodejs)<br>
  This repository coordinates education initiatives such as the certification and documentation for learning Node.js.
