## Want to contribute to Node.js but don't know where to start?

Welcome! You've come to the right place. You can jump right in by going to the working group guides below. You can accelerate getting started in any of these working groups by being introduced to a member of the working group who is knowledgable in the work you'd like to tackle. Context to approaching problems is important and these introductions can save you time working on something the collaborators have already tackled. If you'd like an introduction, [file an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/getting-started/issues) with
- what you'd like to work on or the challenge you're facing
- the working group (if known)

and we'll label your request as `intro requested`. A collaborator will facilitate this for you.
